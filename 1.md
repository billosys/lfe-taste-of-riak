# Prerequisites

To do this tutorial, you will need the following:

* Erlang.
* The Riak database, installed and running on a system.
* The lric wrapper library

## Erlang and Riak

Bash provides a [Quick Start Guide](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/quickstart/) for getting Erlang and Riak up and running, complete with creating a five-node cluster.

Once you finish, you'll need to set up [lric](https://github.com/billosys/lric), whose README file has everythig you need. With that done, you're ready to move on!
