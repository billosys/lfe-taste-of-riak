# A Taste of Riak

*For LFE and the lric Library*

This bit of documentation for the LFE Riak library "lric" is copied nearly in its entirety from the Basho Riak documentation [Taste of Riak](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/taste-of-riak/erlang/).

Thanks to the hard work and excellent results of [Basho](http://basho.com/) and their technical writers (and developers!), providing lric documentation for the LFE community has been a veritable piece of cake. A cake that was, in fact, not a lie.
