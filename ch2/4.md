## Same Keys, Different Buckets

The simplest way to split up data would be to use the same identity key across different buckets. A good example of this would be a ``Customer`` object, an ``Order`` object, and an ``OrderSummaries`` object that keeps rolled up info about orders such as total, etc.

Let's put some data into Riak so we can play with it. Fire up your LFE REPL:

```bash
$ make repl-no-deps
...
LFE Shell V6.2 (abort with ^G)
>
```
