## Configuration Changes

To do this we will have to find Riak's ``riak.conf`` file, which can be
found where your installation keeps its Riak configuration files
(e.g., ``/etc/riak/riak.conf.config``). If you are running SmartOS it will be at ``/opt/local/etc/riak/riak.conf``, and if you used Homebrew to install Riak on OSX it will be at ``/usr/local/Cellar/riak/**VERSION**/libexec/etc/riak.conf``.

### Using the LevelDB Backend for 2i

Open the ``riak.conf`` file in your favorite text editor and search for the ``storage_backend`` setting.

Change it from ``bitcask`` to ``leveldb`` (because only
[LevelDB](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/advanced/backends/leveldb/)
supports secondary indexes, a feature that we'll use in our examples in this tutorial).

Save your ``riak.conf`` and restart riak via the command line:

```bash
$ riak stop
$ riak start
```

Let's make sure the node is up and running:

```bash
$ riak ping
```
