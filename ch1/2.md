## Client Setup

From the install instructions on the [lric README](https://github.com/billosys/lric), you should now have the source code downloaded as well as having the dependencies for lric and lric itself compiled.

Next, start up the LFE REPL using the ``make`` target provided by the lric library (which ensures that all the dependency library paths are passed to LFE, and thus to Erlang):

```bash
$ make repl-no-deps
...
LFE Shell V6.2 (abort with ^G)
>
```

Now letâ€™s create a link to the Riak node. If you are using a single local Riak node, use the following to create the link:

```lisp
> (set `#(ok ,pid) (lric:start "127.0.0.1" 8087))
#(ok <0.32.0>)
```

If you set up a local Riak cluster using the [five-minute install](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/quickstart/) method, use this code snippet instead:

```lisp
> (set `#(ok ,pid) (lric:start-link "127.0.0.1" 10017))
#(ok <0.32.0>)
```

You may have configured Riak to run on a specific IP; in that case be sure to
adjust your command, e.g.:

```lisp
> (set `#(ok ,pid) (lric:start "172.16.4.164" 8087))
#(ok <0.32.0>)
```
