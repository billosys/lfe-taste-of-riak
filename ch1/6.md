## Deleting Objects From Riak

Nothing is complete without a delete, as they say. Fortunately, that's easy too; almost couldn't be simpler:

```lisp
> (lric:delete pid my-bucket key-1)
ok
> (lric:delete pid my-bucket key-2)
ok
```

And then to confirm:

```lisp
> (lric:get pid my-bucket key-1)
#(error notfound)
> (lric:get pid my-bucket key-2)
#(error notfound)
```
